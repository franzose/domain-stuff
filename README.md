# Domain Stuff

It's a common stuff that can be used in almost any project. I'm just tired of copy pasting it over and over again.

1. Identifier which uses UUID 4 internally
2. Domain event dispatcher inspired by [Fesor's repository](https://github.com/fesor/domain-events).

Maybe I'll include an integration glue with Symfony someday.
